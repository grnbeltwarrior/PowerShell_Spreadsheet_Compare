# PowerShell_Spreadsheet_Compare

The idea is to take 2 spreadsheets:
  Old_findings.xlsx
  New_scan_results.xlsx

Then filter out the stuff already in the Old_findings.xlsx. This should result in a New.xlsx with only the new findings.

A lot of learning how to slice and dice 2 spreadsheets with Powershell and how to pick out criteria that mattered between 2 spreadsheets with similar data but different layouts.
